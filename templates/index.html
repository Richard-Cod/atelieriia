    <p class="lead mb-0">And not the other way around.</p>
    <p class="lead">You see, this method allows you to start to gain confidence as well as helps you formulate questions like:</p><p class="lead"><i> "How do I save a form without the page reloading?"</i>

      <p class="lead"><b>1. I am not technical at all, are you sure I should enroll to Coding For Entrepreneurs?</b><br></p>

      <p class="lead  pl-4">There was a time you didn't know how to read, or write, or speak, or walk, or... I believe you are not technical because you didn't take the time to learn through the hard times OR because you haven't even tried OR the class you took, started with the wrong things. <br><br>Coding For Entrepreneurs has a growing community to help you through the tough times, our team will help, the code/software community is incredibly helpful and open, and often times a simple web search will solve your problem. Getting help is easier than EVER and often comes for free.<br><br>So yes. You should <a class="undefined" href="/enroll">enroll</a>.</p></div>

      <div class="mb-2"><p class="lead"><b>2. Why don't I just find a partner or hire a developer?</b><br></p><p class="lead  pl-4">Coding software is about breaking your ideas into rules or steps that a computer can follow. If you don't know how to write these rules or be clear about writing them, a lot (I mean a lot) of time, money, and resources can be wasted.<br>You don't know what you don't know. Restaurant owners might be able to hire chefs to cook food for them, but if you've never eaten food, how would you know you have a good chef or if your food is good? This question becomes much more difficult to answer once your project starts to scale.<br><br>Learning to code is learning to think systemically, logically, and clearly. Being able to code means you'll be able to test ideas rapidly to focus on the things you want to build.</p></div>

      <div class="mb-2"><p class="lead"><b>3. Why don't I just use Wordpress or another platform?</b><br></p><p class="lead  pl-4">This is like asking a chef why he doesn't follow someone else's recipe. The other recipe might be fantastic... but it's still following a recipe. A true chef creates. A cook follows. Using a platform can be great...but to truly innovate, you need to know how to do it yourself.<br><br>Another way to think of this is how rapidly technology can change. If you can't adapt to radical technology change, you'll be trying to run a fast food joint over a single outdoor campfire.</p></div>
